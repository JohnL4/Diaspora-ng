   <h2>What It Is</h2>

   <p>
      An implementation of the Diaspora cluster-generation system (as specified by <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/">VSCA Publishing</a>). 
      You may click on the words of the application title for more
      information.
   </p>

   <h2>Legend</h2>

   <dl>
      <dt>Left cell is Environment (think "sky")</dt>
      <dd>Empty cell is 0. Red, negative; blue, positive. More color means more extreme. Triangle is 1, half-full cell is 2,
         mostly-full cell is 3, full cell is 4.</dd>
      <dt>Right cell is Resources (think "what's in the ground")</dt>
      <dd>As for Environment, but gold is positive, grey is negative.</dd>
      <dt>Hashmarks above/below double square is Technology</dt>
      <dd>Above is positive, below is negative (no hashmarks means T0). One dashed line is level 1, two dashed is 2, solid and
         dashed is 3, two solid is 4. The purple color adds no meaning but might make high-tech worlds easier to spot.</dd>
   </dl>

   <p>So, in general, blue/gold is good; red/grey is bad.</p>

   <p>There's no green because I'm trying to make it color-blind-friendly (at least, the most common form).</p>

   <h2>How To Use It</h2>

   <h3>Create New Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Params" tab, enter the number of star systems in your cluster and hit the "Go!" button.
   </p>

   <h3>Save a Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      To save your cluster to the cloud (sharing will be implemented later), you'll need to log in on the "Session" tab. Currently,
      only Google logins are allowed (more will be implemented later).
   </p>

   <p>
      Once you're logged on, again, on the "Session" tab, enter a name for the cluster and hit "Save"
   </p>

   <h4>XML</h4>

   <p>
      Note that there is also the possibility of extracting the cluster as XML, possibly for use in another cluster-generation
      system. See the "XML" tab.
   </p>

   <h3>Load An Existing Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Params" tab, hit the orange "Load" button on the left side of the row of a cluster you want to edit.
   </p>

   <h3>Delete An Existing Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Params" tab, hit the red "Delete" button on the right side of the row of a cluster you want to delete.
   </p>

   <h3>Edit a Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Cluster" tab, you can hit the "Edit" button at the right end of the row corresponding to a star system. The button
      will change to a "Done" button, which will end edit mode. <em>However</em>, you will still need to save the cluster
      to preserve your edits beyond your session.
   </p>
   <p>
      Once the row is in Edit mode, you can change the star system's name or its aspects, or enter free-form notes about the system.
   </p>

   <p>
      Finally, if you don't like the layout generated, you can drag the cluster nodes around to create a better layout. The canvas
      can be panned by clicking and dragging on white space, and it can be zoomed with the mouse scroll wheel. At this time,
      any changes you make will not be saved (even if you switch to another tab), so don't spend too much effort on rearranging
      the cluster. (Saving geometry changes will come in the future.)
