   <h2>What It Is</h2>

   <p>
      An implementation of the Diaspora cluster-generation system (as specified by <a href="http://www.vsca.ca/" target="_blank">VSCA Publishing</a>). 
      You may click on the words of the application title for more
      information.
   </p>

   <h2>Legend</h2>

   <dl>
      <dt>Left cell is Environment (think "sky")</dt>
      <dd>Empty cell is 0. Blue is positive; red, negative. More color means more extreme. Triangle is 1, half-full cell is 2,
         mostly-full cell is 3, full cell is 4.</dd>
      <dt>Right cell is Resources (think "ground (what's in it)")</dt>
      <dd>As for Environment, but gold is positive, grey is negative.</dd>
      <dt>Hashmarks above/below double square is Technology</dt>
      <dd>Above is positive, below is negative (no hashmarks means T0). One dashed line is level 1, two dashed is 2, solid and
         dashed is 3, two solid is 4. The purple color adds no meaning but might make high-tech worlds easier to spot.</dd>
   </dl>

   <p>So, in general, blue/gold is good; red/grey is bad.</p>

   <p>There's no green because I'm trying to make it color-blind-friendly (at least, the most common form).</p>

   <h2>How To Use It</h2>

   <h3>First, a note on the URLs this thing generates</h3>

   <p>
      This app is a giant blob of Javascript, downloaded statically from the URL <code>https://diaspora.netlify.com</code>.
      All other URLs (e.g., <code>diaspora.netlify.com/params</code>) are illusions generated by the app -- they don't really exist on the
      server.  For that reason, if you try to refresh such a URL, you'll get a 404 error (disguised as a happy "broken link"
      page).
   </p>

   <p>
      If you see the "broken link" page, the "Back to our site" link is likely not to work (because it backs up in
      browser history, which is full of these non-existent URLs).  In that case, just delete
      everything in the browser's address bar except for the original URL: <code>https://diaspora.netlify.com</code>,
      and you should be good.
   </p>

   <p>
      I know it's awful, and I'm going to fix it at some point.  I don't think this is a particular limitation of Angular.
   </p>

   <h3>Create New Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Params" tab, enter the number of star systems in your cluster and hit the "Go!" button.
   </p>

   <h3>Rearrange nodes of the cluster map by dragging, but...</h3>

   <p>
      You can rearrange the nodes of the generated cluster map by dragging them (also, zoom and pan the map view by 
      dragging its whitespace and using the mouse scroll wheel), but, at this time, those changes
      are ephemeral as all get-out, so don't put too much effort into it except as a busy-box kind of thing while you're
      on a conference call.
   </p>

   <h3>Log in to access the database</h3>

   <p>
      To access clusters in the cloud (sharing will be implemented later), you'll need to log in on the "Session" tab. Currently,
      only Google logins are allowed (more will be implemented later).
   </p>

   <p>The rest of this is probably more than you want to know about an irritating login glitch.</p>
   
   <p>
      Logging in works but is a bit glitchy at the moment, because the UI might not accurately update to reflect the
      fact that you're logged in.  Your current user id <em>should</em> be displayed next to the "Login" button, but I
      guess I'm Doing It Wrong, because another UI update cycle (such as that triggered by generating a new cluster)
      is required for the Session tab UI to properly update.
</p><p>
      To verify that you're logged in, if you have previously saved clusters, once you're logged in, you should see them
      on the "Params" tab.  (Alternatively, you can generate a new cluster and look again at the "Session" tab, where you
      should see your user id.  If you already generated a spectacularly awesome cluster and you want to preserve it (a
      sketchy proposition, given that this is alpha software), see XML section below.)
</p><p>
      If you hit "Login", and you get a prompt to enter your password (or pick a user id
      and then enter a password), you're almost certainly in, even though the UI might not update properly.
</p><p>
      For the Google login, if you're logged in to Google on another web page, the login process here should
      automatically pick that up (when you hit the "Login" button).
</p><p>
      Once you're
      logged in, you stay logged in, even between sessions, until you hit the "Logout" button.

   </p>

   <h3>Save a Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      If you're logged in, on the "Session" tab, enter a name for the cluster and hit "Save"
   </p>

   <h4>XML</h4>

   <p>
      Note that there is also the possibility of extracting the cluster as XML, possibly for use in another cluster-generation
      system. See the "XML" tab.
   </p>

   <p>
     When you have a great cluster and you're not sure you're logged in and you don't want to lose your cluster, save
     the XML.  Then, when you get logged in, you can paste your saved XML back into the XML box and blithely continue.
   </p>

   <h3>Load An Existing Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Params" tab, hit the orange "Load" button on the left side of the row of a cluster you want to edit.
   </p>

   <h3>Delete An Existing Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Params" tab, hit the red "Delete" button on the right side of the row of a cluster you want to delete.
   </p>

   <h3>Edit a Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Cluster" tab, you can hit the "Edit" button at the right end of the row corresponding to a star system. The button
      will change to a "Done" button, which will end edit mode. <em>However</em>, you will still need to save the cluster
      to preserve your edits beyond your session.
   </p>
   <p>
      Once the row is in Edit mode, you can change the star system's name or its aspects, or enter free-form notes about the system.
   </p>

   <p>
      Finally, if you don't like the layout generated, you can drag the cluster nodes around to create a better layout. The canvas
      can be panned by clicking and dragging on white space, and it can be zoomed with the mouse scroll wheel. At this time,
      any changes you make will not be saved (even if you switch to another tab), so don't spend too much effort on rearranging
      the cluster. (Saving geometry changes will come in the future.)

   <h2>Credits, Contributions, and Whatnot</h2>

   <p>I intend to keep a list of credits here (assuming I get contributions, which, ya know, who knows?
     <span style="white-space: nowrap; /* border:0px solid transparent; */">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span>&nbsp;).
     I'm happy to field suggestions, observations, complaints, pull requests, all that.</p>

   <p>Graphical cluster notations were inspired by posts on the Google+ Diaspora community (specifically, Jeff Miller's notations).

   <p>If you look at it, you might (justifiably) come to the conclusion that it's a steaming, greasy pile of awfulness,
     but so be it.  This ain't my day job.  I was a Java web developer <em>way</em> back in the pre-Web-2.0 days and I'm
     like Rip van Winkle, having woken up and now attempting to come to grips with the new world.
