   <h2>What It Is</h2>

   <p>
      An implementation of the Diaspora cluster-generation system.  You may click on the words of the application
      title for more information.
   </p>

   <h2>How To Use It</h2>

   <h3>Create New Cluster</h3>

   <p>
   On the "Params" tab, enter the number of star systems in your cluster and hit the "Go!" button.
   </p>

   <h3>Save a Cluster</h3>

   <p>
   To save your cluster to the cloud (sharing will be implemented later), you'll need to log in on the "Session" tab.
   Currently, only Google logins are allowed (more will be implemented later).
   </p>

   <p>
   Once you're logged on, again, on the "Session" tab, enter a name for the cluster and hit "Save"
   </p>

   <h4>XML</h4>

   <p>
      Note that there is also the possibility of extracting the cluster as XML, possibly for use in another 
      cluster-generation system.  See the "XML" tab.
   </p>

   <h3>Load An Existing Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Params" tab, hit the orange "Load" button on the left side of the row of a cluster you want to edit.
   </p>

   <h3>Delete An Existing Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Params" tab, hit the red "Delete" button on the right side of the row of a cluster you want to delete.
   </p>

   <h3>Edit a Cluster</h3>

   <p>
      On the "Cluster" tab, you can hit the "Edit" button at the right end of the row corresponding to a star system.
      The button will change to a "Done" button, which will end edit mode.  <em>However</em>, you will still need to 
      save the cluster to preserve your edits beyond your session.
   </p>
   <p>
      Once the row is in Edit mode, you can change the star system's name or its aspects, or enter free-form notes 
      about the system.
   </p>

   <p>
      Finally, if you don't like the layout generated, you can drag the cluster nodes around to create a better layout.
      The canvas can be panned by clicking and dragging on white space, and it can be zoomed with the mouse scroll wheel.
      At this time, any changes you make will not be saved (even if you switch to another tab), so don't spend too much
      effort on rearranging the cluster.  (Saving geometry changes will come in the future.)
